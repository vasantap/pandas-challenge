Create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.


## Description/Analysis
    This project required us to analyze the district wide standardized test results.
    In this project we were given access to every student's math and reading scores,
    along with some information about the schools they attended. Using this data, and 
    after analyzing it, high level snapshots of District Summary, School Summary,
    Highest performing schools by over percentage of passing, Lowest performing
    schools by over percentage of passing, Math scores by grade, Reading scores by 
    grade, Scores by school spending , Scores by School size, Scores by school type
    were created.
## Conclusion
    After observing the data we can conclude that:
        1) In this district, the average and passing percentage of Reading is more than
         the average and passing percentage of Math.
        2) Of the 15 schools in the district, some are District schools and some are Charter 
         schools. All the Charter schools in this district have an overall pass percentage of
         of almost 90 and above.
        3)The top 5 highest performing schools all of which happen to be charter schools,
         in order of performance are: Cabrera High School, Thomas High School, Griffin High 
         School, Wilson High school followed by Pena High School.
        4)The lowest perfoming schools were some district school which had an average overall 
         pass percentage of about a little over 50.
        5)There isn't much difference in the average math and reading scores by grade.
        6)The most important fact to be noted is that, the spending by a school on students, is
         not necessarily resulting in good results for that school. A deeper investigation on where
         that money is being used and if possible direct it to buy more educational resources might
         help the schools to perform better.
        7) Small to medium size schools seem to be performing better probably because of the less
         teacher to student ratio and individual attention. Larger schools definitely need some
         hanges.
        8) We can see from that the analysis that all the charter schools excelled in performance.
